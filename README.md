World Trivia Game

[Check it out here!](https://barroncn.github.io/TriviaGame/)

This app was my first time using timers (setTimeout, setInterval). The game runs all the way through; the user doesn't have to click anything if they don't want to (they won't get a great score, though). The user gets an alloted amount of time in which to answer the question. If they answer early, the app goes to the next phase (showing the solution for 10 seconds). If the user doesn't answer in time, the app will automatically show the solution. Once the solution has been displayed for its alloted time, the app moves on to the next question. Additionally, the app tracks the number of correct answers, wrong answers, and timed-out answers to show the user at the end of the game on the "stats" page.
